# Tasks: Async execution + GENERATIVE_AI + FORMATTER + PDF text extraction

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-make-workflow-execution/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ‚Üí Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   ‚Üí data-model.md: Extract entities ‚Üí model tasks
   ‚Üí contracts/: Each file ‚Üí contract test task
   ‚Üí research.md: Extract decisions ‚Üí setup tasks
   ‚Üí quickstart.md: Extract end-to-end scenarios ‚Üí integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ‚Üí Setup, Tests (contracts/integration), Core (models/services), Integration (DB/logging), Polish
4. Apply task rules:
   ‚Üí Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   ‚Üí Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ‚Üí Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Provide dependency notes and parallel examples
7. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
- Phase 3.2 (tests) must FAIL before implementing Phase 3.3+ (TDD)
- Models (T020-T023) before services (T030-T033)
- Services before endpoints (T040-T044)
- Async wiring (T050-T052) after endpoints exist
- Frontend updates (T060-T062) after backend contracts stable
- Polish after core passes

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch independent [P] tasks in parallel (different files):
Task: "T010 Update test_workflows_run_post.py to expect {job_id}"
Task: "T011 Add test_jobs_get.py for GET /jobs/{job_id}"
Task: "T012 Add test_files_post.py for POST /files"
Task: "T015 Integration: formatter rules order"

- [x] All entities (Workflow, Node, Job, JobStep, UploadedFile) have model tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] All tests precede implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
