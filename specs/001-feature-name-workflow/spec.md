# Feature Specification: Workflow Builder sample app for assignment

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-name-workflow`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Workflow Builder sample app for assignment ‚Äî A minimal workflow builder demo with FastAPI backend and Vite+React+TS frontend. Users can create workflows, add nodes of types extract_text / generative_ai / formatter, run the workflow, and see the simulated final output. Includes background, goals, non_goals, personas, user_stories, acceptance_criteria, constraints, entities, risks, metrics, assumptions, open_questions from assignment_files."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An assessor can create a workflow, add nodes of various supported types, and run the workflow to view a simulated final output, validating assignment functionality end-to-end.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user provides a workflow name, **When** they POST to create a workflow, **Then** the system returns an id and name.
2. **Given** a workflow id, **When** the user fetches it, **Then** the system returns its name and list of nodes.
3. **Given** a workflow id, **When** the user adds a node with a type and config, **Then** the node is appended and a node_id is returned.
4. **Given** a workflow id with nodes, **When** the user runs the workflow, **Then** the system returns a final_output string representing the simulated run.
5. **Given** the web UI, **When** the user completes the flow of create ‚Üí fetch ‚Üí add nodes ‚Üí run, **Then** they see the final output within two minutes from clean setup.

### Edge Cases
- Missing or invalid workflow id should produce a clear not-found error.
- Adding a node with an unsupported type should be rejected or ignored without crashing.
- Running an empty workflow should return a valid response with initial/default behavior.
- Network/CORS issues must not block expected operations during local development.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to create a workflow by providing a name and return the workflow id and name.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow users to retrieve a workflow by id, including its name and an ordered list of nodes.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow users to add a node to a workflow by specifying the node type and configuration.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide an operation to run a workflow that returns a final_output string representing a simulated execution.
- **FR-005**: The UI MUST allow users to complete the flow: create workflow ‚Üí fetch ‚Üí add supported node types ‚Üí run, and display the result.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST support node types: extract_text, generative_ai, formatter.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST handle not-found workflows with a clear error response.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST ensure local development usability without authentication.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow**: Represents a workflow with attributes: id (string), name (string), nodes (ordered list).
- **Node**: Represents a processing step with attributes: id (string), node_type (one of the supported types), config (key-value parameters).
