# Feature Specification: Optional: DAG Workflows and AI Agent Node

**Feature Branch**: `004-description-optional-support`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "(Optional) Support DAG structure enabling workflows with multiple inputs and outputs. (Optional) Add an AI agent node to workflow execution with capabilities: planning tasks from an objective, determining which tools to use, and automatically recognizing when the task is complete. You may define what an AI agent means in your implementation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn‚Äôt apply, remove it entirely (don‚Äôt leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you‚Äôd need to make
2. **Don‚Äôt guess**: If the prompt doesn‚Äôt specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a workflow author, I want to design workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with nodes that can fan-out and fan-in so that I can orchestrate complex, branching processes. I can include an AI Agent node that, given an objective, plans its sub-steps, selects allowed tools, and decides when it has met the objective, so that some parts of the workflow can adapt dynamically without hardcoding every step.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a workflow canvas, **When** the author creates nodes and connects them into a graph, **Then** the system prevents creation/saving of any cycles and confirms the structure is a DAG.
2. **Given** a DAG with one node producing two outputs, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** both downstream branches start once their inputs are satisfied (fan-out) and the merge node starts only after all required upstream outputs arrive (fan-in).
3. **Given** a workflow with an AI Agent node and an objective, **When** the run reaches the Agent node, **Then** the Agent proposes a plan, executes steps using only allowed tools, and marks the node complete when success criteria are met or a budget/limit is reached.
4. **Given** invalid wiring (missing required inputs), **When** the user attempts to run, **Then** the system blocks execution and explains which node inputs are unsatisfied.
5. **Given** a partial failure in one branch, **When** the workflow policy is set to ‚Äúfail-fast‚Äù, **Then** the overall run stops and surfaces the failing node with diagnostics; **When** set to ‚Äúcontinue-others‚Äù, **Then** independent branches continue.

### Edge Cases
- A user attempts to add an edge that creates a cycle ‚Üí system must detect and block with a clear message.
- A merge node receives some but not all required upstream outputs ‚Üí node must not start until all required inputs arrive (AND join semantics by default).
- Disconnected subgraphs exist in one workflow ‚Üí warn the author and ignore disconnected parts at run-time unless explicitly targeted.
- AI Agent cannot find a plan that meets the objective within limits ‚Üí node ends with a clear ‚Äúunsatisfied objective‚Äù status and rationale.
- Tool call by Agent fails transiently ‚Üí retries up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s); after max attempts, record failure and decide per policy to stop or continue.
- Extremely large fan-out (e.g., 1000 branches) ‚Üí execution limits concurrent node execution to 50 parallel nodes with queuing for additional requests.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support workflows modeled as directed acyclic graphs (no cycles allowed) and validate acyclicity on save and on run.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow nodes to have multiple input ports and multiple output ports, with explicit wiring between ports.
- **FR-003**: System MUST determine run order via topological scheduling; a node becomes runnable only when all required upstream dependencies are satisfied.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support fan-out (one output to many downstream nodes) and fan-in (a node starting after all required upstream dependencies complete - AND join semantics).
- **FR-005**: System MUST reject or block execution of graphs that have cycles, missing required inputs, or dangling edges, and present actionable validation messages.
- **FR-006**: System MUST expose per-node and per-run status, timestamps, and human-readable diagnostics suitable for triage and auditing.
- **FR-007**: System SHOULD provide run controls including pause/resume and cancel for both whole runs and individual branches, with best-effort guarantees for in-flight operations.
- **FR-008**: System SHOULD guarantee repeatable execution for deterministic nodes (same inputs ‚Üí same outputs); for non-deterministic nodes (AI agents, external APIs), the system MUST surface non-determinism clearly in run logs.
- **FR-009**: System MUST optionally support an AI Agent node that accepts an objective and context inputs, can propose a plan of sub-steps, select from an allowed toolset, and execute until completion criteria are met or limits are reached.
- **FR-010**: The AI Agent MUST operate within bounded policies (tool whitelist, max 10 concurrent operations, 30-second timeout per tool call, configurable token/cost budgets) and record rationale, chosen tools, and outcomes.
- **FR-011**: The AI Agent MUST have clear termination criteria: success (objective met), failure (objective not met), or budget-exhausted, and must signal which condition occurred.
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to preview the Agent's proposed plan as a list of steps and optionally approve/modify the plan before execution begins.
- **FR-013**: System MUST record inputs and outputs metadata for each node, automatically redacting fields marked as sensitive or matching common patterns (API keys, passwords, PII).
- **FR-014**: System MUST support policy options on branch failure: fail-fast (default), continue-others, or custom policies defined per workflow.
- **FR-015**: System SHOULD allow reusable subgraphs (fragments) with defined input/output interfaces to be embedded as nodes to reduce duplication across workflows.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-XXX**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-YYY**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow**: A named orchestration of nodes and edges; declares global inputs/outputs and policies.
- **Node**: A unit of work with typed input/output ports; includes types such as Task node and AI Agent node.
- **Edge**: A directed connection from an output port to an input port; may include optional conditions.
- **Run**: A single execution instance of a workflow with overall status and timing.
- **NodeRun**: Execution record for a node within a run; includes status, inputs, outputs, and diagnostics.
- **AgentNode**: A node configured with objective, allowed tools, limits, and termination criteria.
- **Tool**: A capability that the Agent may invoke; defined by purpose, inputs/outputs, and constraints.
- **Objective**: Human-authored intent and optional success criteria used by the Agent to plan.
